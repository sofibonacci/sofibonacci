## Hi there! 👋  

I'm **Sofía Gurruchaga**, a:  
🚀 **Software Engineer** at JPMorgan Chase  
🎓 **Advanced Computer Science BSc + MSc Student** at FCEN, UBA (Argentina)  
☁️ **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**  

[Here](https://sofibonacci.github.io/resume/SofiaGurruchaga.pdf) is my resume!


### About Me  
I enjoy coding in various languages, including **C++**, **Python**, and **Smalltalk**. Most of my public repositories are coding exercises from college or personal projects where I experiment with different technologies.  

Look at my really cool vintage web 1.0 themed [website!](https://sofibonacci.github.io/personal_webpage/)

I also had the opportunity to collaborate to Cuis, an open-source Smalltalk-80 system. [This is my contribution](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Calendars/commit/8a5168b39b0606fc1137b5ab9dddfc07d061b58d) of a terse guide for the Chalten Package, an implementation of a rich Gregorian calendar model with dates and calendars in Cuis.

📬 You can reach me through my LinkedIn (should be somewhere on this page).

Thanks for stopping by—have a great day! 🚀
