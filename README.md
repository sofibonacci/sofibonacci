### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm SofÃ­a Gurruchaga, advanced Computer Science student @ FCEN, UBA, Argentina. 

I love learning more and more about computers and its wonders. 

When I was 3 years old I played my first videogame, it taught numbers and letters (MatemÃ¡ticas con Pipo running on Win 98); now I code with those numbers and letters. 

I like solving challenges as those in programming contests. 

Also liked all the Algorithms & Data Structers I learnt in college. I love sortings algorithms such as Quick Sort.   

My contact info is on my LinkedIn profile, it should be somewhere in this page. You can reach me there for collaborations or discussions. 

Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!
