### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm SofÃ­a Gurruchaga, an advanced Computer Science student at FCEN, UBA, Argentina.

I love learning more and more about computers and their wonders.

When I was 3 years old, I played my first video game; it taught numbers and letters (MatemÃ¡ticas con Pipo running on Win 98). Now I code with those numbers and letters.

I like solving challenges like those in programming contests.

I also enjoyed learning all the Algorithms & Data Structures in college. I love sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort.

My contact info is on my LinkedIn profile, it should be somewhere on this page. You can reach me there for collaborations or discussions.

Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!
